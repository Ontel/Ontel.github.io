      <div class="content">
        <span>Technology enables us to do what wasn't possible before, and with the convergence of LTE/high-speed networks, and with better than ever hardware at accessible prices, we are witnessing the end of the old adage that you can't have "cheaper, faster, and better" all at once. We are proof of this. Our in-house developed software like Swift Projects, along with other tools and scripts that automate things like Anritsu Sweep processing and validation, ATT's RET forms, or Verizon Wireless' RF Summary in the BAWA/DC market, hit all three factors at the same time. Our people, matched with this exceptional technological capability enables us to provide higher quality services, at higher rates, less expensively than traditional companies can.</span>

        <span>Included in this service is our consultation to get scope specific items into the workflow within Swift Projects. Also included in our price is the typical mini-C.O.P. package many carriers expect on either the same day of construction completion or soon thereafter. This list is not exhaustive, however here are the main items we manage on your behalf. This management entails the review, reporting, and processing necessary to take raw files from testing equipment, cameras, and other sources to C.O.P acceptance.</span>

          As part of a close out for various construction, scoping, or audit scopes of work, you may need a greater depth of documentation than your typical photo or video C.O.P. set can provide. This may include a drone audit, photogrammetry, pointclouds etc. We advise and help our clients perform these new types of services, so don't hesitate to ask us how to incorporate this into your portfolio and begin offering them to your clients.
