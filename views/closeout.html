      <div class="heading">How can we lead across quality, speed, and cost?</div>
      <div class="content">
        <span>Technology is how we provide the highest quality technical and construction input throughout the closeout process while also leading in speed and cost. We do this through our use of Swift Traces™ and Swift Projects™ where we automate the processing of Sweep Traces, and centralize project files and workflows. We also create custom project specific scripts and software, for example we've automated ATT's RET value forms, and Verizon BAWA's RF Summary test entry. Our people matched with this exceptional technology enables us to streamline the processing of high-amounts of data and close out faster than anyone else.</span>

          As part of a closeout for varying construction, scoping, or audit scopes of work, you may need a greater depth of documentation than your typical photo or video C.O.P. set, such as a drone flyover, photogrammetry, etc. We advise and help our clients meet these new demands, don't hesitate to ask about how to accommodate for these new types of requirements.
