          As part of a close out for various construction, scoping, or audit scopes of work, you may need a greater depth of documentation than your typical photo or video C.O.P. set can provide. This may include a drone audit, photogrammetry, pointclouds etc. We advise and help our clients perform these new types of services, so don't hesitate to ask us how to incorporate this into your portfolio and begin offering them to your clients.
