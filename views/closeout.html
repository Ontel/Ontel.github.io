      <div class="content">
        <span>Technology is how we provide the highest quality technical and construction input throughout the close out process while also leading in speed and cost. We do this through our use of Swift Traces™ and Swift Projects™, where we automate the processing of Anritsu sweep test data, and centralize project files and workflows into a GUI interface that's smart, and easy to use. We also create custom project specific scripts and applications that deal with data transfer between differently formatted data, for example we've automated AT&T's RET value forms, as well as the data entry of test values into Verizon Wireless' RF Summary in the Baltimore/Washington market. Our people, matched with this exceptional technological capability enables us to streamline the processing of high-amounts of data and close projects faster than anyone else.</span>
