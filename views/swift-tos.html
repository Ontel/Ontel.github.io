        <p>Welcome to Swift Projects. Please read these terms of service (these "Terms") carefully as they form a contract between you and the Ontel entity listed in Section 17 of these Terms ("Ontel", "we", "us", or "our") that governs your access and use of the web-based business management application known as Swift Project (“Swift”). It also governs your access and use of the hosted storage solution aspects of Swift for online content storage, sharing and processing of files, materials, data, text, audio, video, images or other content (collectively, "Content"); (ii) the Ontel websites or applications; and (iii) any written or electronic use or features guides or other documentation provided or made available by Ontel (the "User Guides") (collectively the "Service(s)").</p>
        <p><span>By registering or using any of the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms.</span> If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and promising to Ontel that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms (in which event, "you" and "your" will refer to that organization) unless that organization has a separate paid contract in effect with us, in which event the terms of that contract will govern your use of the Service. You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and only if you have the power to form a contract with Ontel and are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, YOU MUST NOT USE THE SERVICES. Should you have any questions concerning this Agreement, please contact <a href="hello@ontel.co">hello@ontel.co</a></p>
        <p>Please note that Ontel doesn't provide warranties for the Services. This contract also limits our liability to you. See Sections 14 (NO WARRANTY) and 16 (LIMITATION OF LIABILITY) of these Terms for details.</p>

We will date and post the most current version of these Terms on the Ontel website, or within the app. Any changes will be effective upon posting the revised version of these Terms (or such later effective date as may be indicated at the top of the revised Terms).

Notice of other changes may be provided via <a href="www.Ontel.co">www.Ontel.co</a> (the “Site”) or related Ontel blogs. Therefore, we encourage you to check the date of these Terms whenever you visit the Site to see if these Terms have been updated.

        <p>Upon termination by Ontel, for reasons other than cause, you may request access to your Content, which we will make available for an additional fee.

Otherwise, any Content you have stored with the Service will not be retrievable, and we will have no obligation to maintain any data stored in your account.</p>
        <p>In addition to other termination provisions, if your account it not currently subject to a paid subscription plan with us, we at our discretion may terminate your account if: (a) you do not engage in any activity in your account within thirty (30) days after becoming a Registered User; or (b) you do not engage in any activity in your account for any period of one hundred and twenty (120) consecutive days.

        <h2>21. MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
        <h2>21.1. Severability; Entire Agreement</h2>
        <p>These Terms apply to the maximum extent permitted by relevant law. If a court holds that we cannot enforce a part of these Terms as written, you and we will replace those terms with similar terms to the extent enforceable under the relevant law, but the rest of these Terms will remain in effect. This is the entire contract between you and us regarding the Service. It supersedes any prior contract or oral or written statements regarding your use of the Service.</p>
        <h2>21.2. Assignment and transfer</h2>
        <p>We may assign, transfer, or otherwise dispose our rights and obligations under this contract, in whole or in part, at any time without notice. You may not assign this contract or transfer any rights to use the Service.</p>
        <h2>21.3. Independent Contractors; No third-party beneficiaries</h2>
        <p>Ontel and you are not legal partners or agents; instead, our relationship is that of independent contractors. This contract is solely for your and our benefit. It is not for the benefit of any other person, except for permitted successors.</p>
        <h2>21.4. Claims</h2>
        <p>Claims must be filed within one year. You must bring any claim related to these Terms or the Service within one year of the date you could first bring the claim, unless your local law requires a longer time to file claims. If it isn't filed in time, the claim is permanently barred.</p>
        <h2>21.5. Waiver</h2>
        <p>The failure of either party to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any of the provisions of these Terms or to exercise any rights or remedies under these Terms will not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent of such party's right to assert or rely upon any such provision, right or remedy in that or any other instance; rather, the same will remain in full force and effect.</p>
