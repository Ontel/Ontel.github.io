			<p>Swift Projects™ puts the power to design, run, and close multiple projects simultaneously into the palm of your hand. With a phone or browser, Swift enables you to design detailed project workflows with 3 simple building blocks. Those blocks then automate administrative and management tasks like status updates, scheduling, uploading and downloading, and relabelling files. Most importantly for our clients, Swift eliminates mistakes and waste related with sharing and collaborating ineffectively in clean and easy to use interface.

		<div class="content">
			<p>Swift Projects™ allows our clients to share photos and videos from the field and put them directly into QA approval process live for multiple simultaneous reviewers to access in real time. What Swift Projects™ does for your organization is more than just organizing projects and their workflows, it helps organizations implement best practices and standardization of quality at scale in an immediate way.
